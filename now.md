I'm a student at Princeton University majoring in Computer Science, and minoring in Creative Writing. 

This page is a catch-all of what I've been up to lately, as well as a few things from the near past and the near future. It was last updated **December 20th, 2016**.

# What I did (recently):

* Spoke on a panel at GaymerX 4 about Game Jams
* Made a strategy game in August 2016 called [The Four Old Gods](https://amorphous.itch.io/the-four-old-gods), which can be downloaded for free for Windows.
* Gave a talk at !!con: [Mixing Paint! With Computers!](http://confreaks.tv/videos/bangbangcon2016-mixing-paint-with-computers)

# What I'm doing:

* being a college student (it's taking up a lot of my time!)
* writing a fantasy novel for my senior thesis
* developing a dungeon-crawling RPG video game named **Farsider**

# What I will be doing: <span class='small'>if things go according to plan</span>
