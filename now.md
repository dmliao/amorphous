# What I'm doing now:

This list was last updated **October 2015**.

I'm a student at Princeton University majoring in Computer Science. I am also pursuing a minor in Creative Writing.

# I'm also:

* developing a dungeon-crawling RPG video game named **Farsider**.
* writing a novel (since summer 2014) (working title: Crimson)
* working on independent research for school (web platform to edit/view 2D animations created by warping and deforming artwork instead of a series of frames)

# Availability:

I am **not** available for freelance web design / development.
