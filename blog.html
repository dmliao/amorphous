<h1>Blog</h1>
    <p>Hi there. I've been maintaining this blog for four years, but never actually made it public until now. I post sporadically; I write more often via mailing list, and sometimes I polish up the thoughts I make there to post here. Older posts have only been roughly edited and may not always be entirely cohesive, but I hope that they are useful or informative in their own way.</p>
