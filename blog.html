<h1>Blog</h1>
    <p>Hi there. This isn't exactly a traditional blog with thought-out articles or tutorials, but rather more like a journal of interesting things and notes I took along the way. Anytime I do something that was surprisingly difficult, or complete a project, or go to an interesting event, I might have notes that make their way here. These posts have only been roughly edited and may not always be entirely cohesive, but I hope that they are useful or informative in their own way.</p>
