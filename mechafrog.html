                <p>MechaFrog is a unique shooter that blends bullet-hell and turret-defense elements, all to the backdrop of an absurdist story about a robotic frog with an existential crisis.

            <p>Take control of the World's Only MechaFrog as you create 6 different turrets to blast your way through flies, beetles, and other bugs - all inexplicably armed with various laser cannons. Defeat the Lord of the Flies that's menacing the frogs' precious Lake, and figure out what MechaFrog having an existential crisis has to do with all of this.</p>

            <p><ul>
                <li>6 different types of turrets, each with unique effects and uses. Strategy is key!</li>
                <li>36 bug-infested levels, split into 4 Worlds. Each world crazier than the last.</li>
                <li>Casual, yet insanely difficult: Each level lasts only a few minutes before MechaFrog nukes the whole place to victory. The challenge is staying alive that long. Can you do it?</li>
