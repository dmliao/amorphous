title: Crisis Solver, an RPG
---


Characters go through a series of rooms / area (what is the location?), trying to solve some sort of disaster, which may or may not end in success. Plays out in 3 acts. 

Examples: trying to fix an airship before you crash, trying to escape a dungeon, trying to clean the bathroom

# Theme

The game runs on a theme, which will determine the makeup of areas, and possibly what skills or backgrounds characters may have.

# Character Creation

A character has a name, a short physical description, and a drawing (if possible)

You can also assign a high concept (what kind of person they want to be) to them. If during a game you accomplish something that moves you towards your high concept, you gain 2 desperation dice.

For background, a character can choose from a list. Each character chooses two/three objects from the themes list, and figures it into the backstory. One object is a positive memory, and one object is a negative memory, the optional third object is a bittersweet or neutral one. (some games with a shorter timespan may not have any backstory at all play into it, so this part can be safely skipped)

Each character has three skills that they're good at, and two that they're bad at. Mark that on your character sheet.

Each character has 2 physical hit points, and 2 mental hit points. A character can also hold up to 4 objects normally.

## Skills

Athletics - used for any physical contest, fighting, etc.
Communication - used for any emotional contest, trying to persuade, deceive, provoke, etc. (when trying to tell other people what to do, etc.)
Crafting - used for combining, building, or modifying existing objects
Education - used for how to read a particular text, or identifying objects
Investigate - used for determining the surroundings, or finding a particular object / person, finding entrances, exits
Operate - used for operating machinery or any other complex object
Perception - used to notice anything strange or new that has happened, or any movement in an area

# Areas

Each area is a room, or a single space that can be traversed relatively quickly (within 10 seconds) and can be seen in its entirety without moving e.g. a closed-off alcove in a room might be a separate area)

Each area has a few traits, and a few objects that can be interacted with. 

## Area Connections

Areas can be connected to other areas, allowing characters to move between them. Connections typically are doors, passageways, or anything else that separates two areas but are passable.

Connections can have traits as well, which impact how characters can interact with them.

### Connection Traits

Impassable - there should be a connection here, but something has blocked it off and made it impossible to use. Can be temporary (locked door) or permanent (area beyond it lost in fire)
Difficult - the connection is difficult to pass, requiring the full round to pass it (and thus cannot be passed if another action has already been taken). Events such as stuck doors may be temporarily difficult, hazardous terrain may be permanently difficult.

## Area traits

An area can have a few traits that can be gained or lost, such as:

Dark - all objects start off hidden, characters take disadvantage on all checks except athletics and communication, and perception based on hearing
Loud - all characters take disadvantage on communication and perception (based on hearing)
Hazardous - requires athletics check to be able to enter. If failed, the character returns to the previous area with 1 physical damage, and that player cannot take further actions or movements this round (cannot be starting point)
Restless - it's difficult to rest here because of excessive movement, noise, etc. Characters have disadvantage on rest checks.

## Area key points

An area can have several points of interest that would require more investigating. A cluttered desk, a bookshelf, may be dense with objects and hard to search without going through manually. Those key points are described loosely by the GM when a character enters the area, but the character must search (investigate) the key point specifically to find objects in them.

Key points do not have traits of their own.

## Area objects

An area contains several objects, which are found at each of the area's key points. A general description of an area can be given by the GM when a character enters the area, but the specific objects inside are only discovered upon an investigation.

### Object traits

In Plain Sight - characters learn of this object's existence without investigating.
Hidden - players do not immediately know of this object's existence
Immobile - the object cannot be picked up and carried
Large - if a character is carrying this object, they cannot carry any other objects.
Heavy - requires an athletics check to carry.
Activation X - can be activated to do something else. Some complex objects need an Operate check to activate. (requires X rounds to properly activate after a successful Operate)
Broken X (if the object has a purpose) - currently cannot be activated. Can be repaired with a crafting check, though some will require the character to be holding a specific part for the crafting to work. (requires X rounds of crafting to properly fix, 0 means that the object is broken beyond repair)
Strange - requires an Education check to figure out what the object does
Bag X - can hold X additional non-large, non-heavy objects if you're carrying this.
Hands Free - you can carry this without taking an object slot. You can only use this feature with one object at a time.

# Playing the game

## Act I

Introduce the areas, at least the starting areas, and the characters. All the characters now have to answer the following question:

Why are you here?
Do you know each other? If so, how?

Be creative, and link to other characters' backstories if it's relevant. The characters have a moment to relax, chat, or do whatever they were doing in that area.

Have each character roll a d20 for turn order. GM goes around and has them say what they want to do, time is pretty fluid. Most of this should be characters talking to each other or investigating the current area. If a character wanders off, they can visit one adjacent area, and quickly investigate.

After this one round, the GM gives a hint for some Bad Thing that will happen, which can be rolled off the following chart:

Mechanical Malfunction
It's a Trap!
Caught in a Storm
We have to escape the <area> before __________
Nothing has been cleaned and guests will be over soon
The Power is out and we want to watch Netflix
We have to activate a ________ or else __________

Each of those Bad Things causes a few objects to change, which can be noticed with perception checks (if in the starting area), or observed on investigation. GMs now assign a goal, which the players may not know about, that if the players accomplish, would 'solve' or at least mitigate this crisis (e.g. turn on the generator, open the door, activate the laser beams) - more complex crises may have multiple goals that must all be met.

Alternatively, the GM can start in media res with the bad thing having happened already, and immediately proceed to Act II once the players are aware that something is wrong. 

*By the time Act II starts, the players should know that something is wrong, but not necessarily what it is.*

## Act II - crisis

Players use the same turn order, though turns are now confined to 12 seconds apiece (5 per minute). During a turn, a character can move, and perform one action:

### Actions

* investigate an area (find objects)
* search a particular key point in the area (find hidden objects)
* take as many objects as you need to from a key point in the area (that you know the existence of)
* examine an object up close (education check) - either in your possession or in a key point. (you can take possession of this item)
* interact with as many objects as you want in a key point (with objects in your inventory) - such as trying to open a door with a key, etc.
* begin crafting an object
* begin operating an object
* stand at alert (advantage on perception checks for anything new in same and adjacent areas)
* set up a reaction (help another character in the same area, advantage on checks)
* think (roll Education, on success, the GM might give you a hint as to what's going wrong.)
* ??? (anything improvised that can be done in 10 seconds)
* rest (add a rest point, helps restore physical and mental hit points)

If you're doing something under stress or with a chance of failure, the GM can have you make the appropriate skill check. To do that, roll 2d6. If you're good at the skill, add a d6, otherwise take one away. If you have advantage, add a d6 as well, disadvantage removes one. (If you're at 1d6, subtract 1 from the roll, so it becomes 1d6-1).

If you have any desperation dice, you can add as many as you want to the roll.

At least one die must meet or beat the DC for success. If multiple dice do, then you do exceptionally well on it. If only one does, you succeed, but the GM might introduce a complication (success at a cost). If none of the dice succeed, you fail, and may suffer a consequence. However, if you fail, you add 1d6 to your desperation pool.

DC:

1 - why are we rolling?
2 - trivial
3 - easy
4 - normal
5 - difficult
6 - very difficult

Remember, at any time, you can carry 4 objects, unless an object has a Hands Free trait, or you have a Bag.

### Resting & Hit points

When you fail a check, sometimes you'll lose hit points. Failing an Athletics check usually causes you to lose a physical hit point, representing an injury of some sort (may also happen on a success at a cost). Failing an Education or Investigate check may cause you to lose a mental hit point, representing frustration and stress.

If either value hits 0, the only action your character can take is to rest, until your hit points are at least 1 in both categories.

Each consecutive round you rest, you gain a rest point. You can also choose physical or mental, and roll a 1d6, with DC equal to 7 - # of rest points, with a minimum of 2. If you pass the DC, you regain a hit point.

You lose all your rest points as soon as you regain a hit point, or do anything besides resting.

If you rest in a restless location, you take disadvantage on all rest checks.
