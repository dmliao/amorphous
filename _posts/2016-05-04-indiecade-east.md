title: Notes from IndieCADE East, 2016
wip: true
---

I attended IndieCADE East for the second time in 2016, three years after I'd gone the first time. In that time, I'd quit gamedev, gone to college, unquit gamedev, and participated in a few game jams. 

This time, I had no pretenses of going to IndieCADE East to show off my own game. Show and tell sign ups were no longer on-site, but an application weeks before (that I didn't apply to). I wasn't hoping to plug my own projects, not that I had much to show at the moment. The project I was working on was so early in development showing it would've been pointless, and I wanted more an opportunity to just play games and talk to other developers.

I think I did just that. I played some delightfully weird games, and I talked to some delightful people. In addition, I actually did show my project to a few people? Despite it just being a few screenshots? Anyway, I had fun.

Unfortunately, in this three-year timespan I'd fallen out of the habit of actually taking notes (and taking pictures, apparently), so a lot of this summary is paraphrased at best. Apologies in advanced.

# Panels! Panels!

I didn't go to that many talks, partly because I was too busy playing games, partly because I didn't plan things out too well.

The panels I went to were mostly about logistics: how to make money making games, how to build a community. A few takeaways, from a variety of panels and conversations, in no particular order:

1. Move to Canada - Apparently a good deal of Toronto gamedev was at IndieCADE, and multiple people mentioned to me (both in conversation and in panels) that the Canadian government gives out grants for games and other artistic endeavors. Alas, moving to Canada is not exactly in the books.
2. It's possible to create community where there is none right now. But that means that you have to take the initiative. This is more relevant to me, since I'm from a place where there really is no community at the moment. There are people interested in game development everywhere, it's a matter of figuring out where to start, how to find other interested developers, and putting it all together.
3. It's hard to make a living off of indie game dev. Okay, I knew this already, but it's _hard_. Even if you do live in Canada.

As an aside, I also went to a panel on VN development, in hopes of reconnecting with the VN community (long story), but it felt very insular and closed-off. Maybe next time, I suppose.
