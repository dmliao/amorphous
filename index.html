    <h1 class='home-emphasis'>Hi, I'm Diana.</h2>
    <p>(I go by Amorphous online.)<p>
    <p>I'm a software engineer, game developer, artist, writer, and composer.</p>
    <h2 class='home-emphasis'>I make things:</h3>
    <p>Games, applications, websites, or anything else that is pretty and moves on a computer. I like building things and seeing them tick, and I like telling stories through words and pictures.</p>
    <p><a href='/now'>Here's what I'm working on at the moment.</a></p>

    <p>For some reason, <a href="https://tinyletter.com/amorphous">I also have a mailing list</a>, which I use to talk about my current projects in some depth and dive into curious topics. It updates at most once every two weeks.</p>
